## Intro

- I successfully completed Workshop 0 and was inspired to create another animation using similar techniques for the workshop 1. For my next project, I decided to develop a butterfly animation, focusing primarily on changing its colors dynamically. I referred to the p5.js tutorial on variables and change (https://p5js.org/tutorials/variables-and-change/) and explored various online resources for creating butterfly animations. There were numerous exemplars and projects related to butterfly animations, many of which were highly engaging and provided valuable inspiration.
- https://www.artstation.com/artwork/VgaveP
- https://thecodingtrain.com/challenges/60-butterfly-generator / it was quite challenging on making a real butterfly, and may be too complicated so using this as a reference on my problem solving.
- so decided to make the shape oval and make it a flapping motion using **sin(angle)**. Using ellipse(oval) () too for the wing shape. 
- I began to follow the instructions on the Workshop 1, reading on p5js references and what code to work on.

**using sin(angle) was to use the flapping motion very smooth back and forth.**


## Conclusion

- Creating a loop animation with a bouncing screen effect worked very well, as I was able to successfully applying the technique by closely following the lecture videos for guidance.I was quite impressed with how smoothly the process went when coding basic animations, which motivated me to further improve my skills by exploring and experimenting with new coding techniques.
- For this animation, it looks a butterfly is wandering off from the screen, even playing and bouncing around which was beginner step, and I am quite excited on what I could do next to the next level of coding.
