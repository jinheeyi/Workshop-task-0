## Intro

- After following the first class of this course, I decided to focus on exploring basic shapes, but new shapes, such as stars or polygons, to keep the process straightforward, and experience new coding. So, thought about creating a simple animation on a star bouncing off the screen. 
- Kept researching on exemplars and youtube videos on how to make a star, and workshop 0 and 1 videos. 
- The primary research involved exploring coding techniques for creating star shapes and referencing the resources available on the p5.js website (https://p5js.org/reference/). However, working with the codes proved to be quite challenging.

## Notes(working progress)

**Creating a real star.**

- The star had a lot of codes happening for example; using radius1, 2 and npoints to draw the star and even to position the star on where it bounces off to. I had a little help from youtube, and google and chatgpt on how to make a star. Using https://p5js.org/tutorials/variables-and-change/, and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSp5iSTXwAY


## Conclusion

- Creating a loop animation with a bouncing screen effect worked very well, as I was able to successfully applying the technique by closely following the lecture videos for guidance.I was quite impressed with how smoothly the process went when coding basic animations, which motivated me to further improve my skills by exploring and experimenting with new coding techniques.
- For this animation, it looks like a star is wandering off from the black sky, even playing and bouncing around which was beginner step, and I am quite excited on what I could do next to the next level of coding.
