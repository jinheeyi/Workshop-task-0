# workshop_1_

- after the first class of this course, I decided to focus on exploring new shapes, such as stars and polygons, to keep the process straightforward, and experience. So, I thought of creating a simple shooting star, thinking it step by step. 
- to achieving this, I researched coding techniques for creating star shape and referred to the resources available on the p5.ja website https://p5js.org/reference/ which it was quite difficult on working the codes right. 

## testing

- working first two workshop videos, I started to getting used to on making basic shapes like triangles and circles, and even moving and bouncing off the screen. It worked very well, by looking at the lecture videos. https://canvas.auckland.ac.nz/courses/121821/pages/week-1-overview?module_item_id=2435967
- this is the code for the star, bouncing off, which is a good start, by asking www.google.com to demonstrate on how to make complex shapes, like this.
