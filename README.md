# workshop_1_

After the first class of thsi course, I decided to focus on exploring new shapes, such as stars and polygons, to keep the process straightforward, and experience. 
To achieving this, I researched coding techniques for creating star shape and referred to the resources available on the p5.ja website (https://p5js.org/refernce/).

## testing

Working first two workshop videos, I started to getting used to on making basic shapes like triangles and circles, and even moving and bouncing off the screen.
this is the code for the star, bouncing off, which is a good start.
