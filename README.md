# workshop_1_
After the first class of thsi course, I decided to focus on exploring new shapes, such as stars and polygons, to keep the process straightforward, and experience. 
To achieving this, I researched coding techniques for creating star shape and referred 
to the resources available on the p5.ja website (https://p5js.org/refernce/).
Working first two workshop videos, I started to getting used to on making basic shapes like triangles and circles, and even moving and bouncing off the screen.
I've learnt the code on using the background from the workshop videos etc.
