## intro

- after following the first class of this course, I decided to focus on exploring basic shapes, but new shapes, such as stars and polygons, to keep the process straightforward, and experience. So, thought about creating a simple animation on a star bouncing off the screen. 
- to achieving this, I researched coding techniques for creating star shape and referred to the resources available on the p5.ja website https://p5js.org/reference/ which it was quite difficult on working the codes right.
- playing with colours and speed movement.

## testing

**(background)**
on the lecture video, workshop 1, I wanted to make the background black with the mixture of dark blue included. so started with the background () to get the basic step.

creating a real star. 

- creating a loop animation on bouncing the screen effect.It worked very well, by looking at the lecture videos. https://canvas.auckland.ac.nz/courses/121821/pages/week-1-overview?module_item_id=2435967
- what i wasn't quite impressed or missing a point for the shooting star, is that the background was too black (plain) and plus the speed of the shooting star
